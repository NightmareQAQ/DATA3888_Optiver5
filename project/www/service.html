              <h4>RE</h4>
              <p>As the first approach in this project, the regression model was incorporated with the aim of analysing and modelling the volatility of stock prices for predictive analysis. Often noted as a statistical/numerical based method, it allowed us to model the relationship between volatility and external variables and represent how these variables impact volatility over time (Rishi, 2022). Through its implementation, it allowed our project to model and evince the relationship various factors have on volatility, ultimately allowing us to predict and forecast volatility beyond the past and present</p>

              <h4>HAV</h4>
              <p>This HAV model was chosen to model and predict volatility as it directly works on the time series of realised volatility. As the second approach for this project, it takes into account the time scales present with volatility and incorporates this primarily with the assumption that specific time scales often result with different perceptions towards volatility and its factors. This often leads to what is known as an “additive volatility cascade” and via an autoregressive model, allows for predictions and forecasts of volatility across different aspects in time (Clements &amp; Preve, 2019).</p>

              <h4>ARMA-GARCH</h4>
              <p>A combination of both ARMA and GARCH models were used as the third approach to the project for predicting volatility as it is specifically able to capture time-varying volatility. The model captures what is known as the ‘volatility clustering phenomenon’ where a period of high volatility is immediately followed by a period of low volatility and vice versa; a common theme in financial time series data (Cont, 2017). The ARMA aspect works to model and evaluate the autocorrelation and moving mean patterns in datasets, evaluating recurring patterns in volatility. The GARCH aspect captures the dynamics of volatility by implementing logged residuals as a predictor of current volatility, allowing for the modelling of conditional heteroskedasticity (non-constant volatility from past time periods) as volatility is time-dependent (Ghani &amp; Rahim, 2023).</p>
